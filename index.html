        I had to be near you
        Thoughts in mind, going so crazy
        I just wanna hear you
        One touch on your body, what I've prepared for you
        Nothing will spare you
        Pussy so wet, I feel the drip coming down
        Must be in Houston
        You close your eyes, you feel the rise, I go inside
        I'm shooting (on sight)
